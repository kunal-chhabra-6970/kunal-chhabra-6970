### Hi techies

<!--
**kunal-chhabra-6970/kunal-chhabra-6970** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->I am Kunal Chhabra, a final year student at Indian Institute of Information Technology(IIIT), Una. From the last 2 years , I have been doing Android development and have gained good experience in it by doing internship thrice . Throughout my college years, I have made some really interesting projects and successfully deployed them on Google Play Store . One of my apps 'CricTracker' has 9K+ downloads on it currently. My freelancing projects too are currently live on Google Play Store with the name of 'ServON' and 'ServON Vendor' respectively. In my internship experience , I had the chance to explore MVC , MVP as well as MVVM architecture, which made me quite proficient with Java , Kotlin and latest Android tech stacks like Coroutines , Dagger and other Jetpack components. In case of any fruitful discussions or interesting contributions, I am happy to connect :)
